          equipment must be switched off.
        </li>
        <li>

          Surfing the Internet is allowed only with the permission of the

          Deleting computer files and changing the set-up of the computer is a
          major offense.
        </li>
        <li>
          Observe computer time usage carefully. A fifteen-minute allowance is
          given for each use. Otherwise, the unit will be given to those who
          wish to “sit-in.”
